## 🔍 Data Quality Analysis Results

### 5 Major Inconsistency Types Identified:

| Issue Type | Affected Rows | Business Impact | Resolution Strategy |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Date Format Issues** | 27 | Cannot calculate delivery times | Standardize to DD-MM-YYYY format |
| **Duplicate Order IDs** | 4,985 | Overstated sales figures | Create composite key (Order ID + Product ID) |
| **Incomplete Postal Codes** | 449 | Incorrect regional reporting | Validate against USPS database |
| **Invalid Numeric Values** | 4 | False revenue calculations | Remove negatives, escalate to business |
| **Missing Numeric Values** | 234 | Incomplete profit analysis | Apply business rules for missing values |

**Total Data Quality Score: 87.3%**

### Key Insights:
- **Critical Issue**: Duplicate Order IDs affecting 4,985 records require immediate business attention
- **Data Governance Gap**: Need for standardized data entry protocols
- **Regional Data Quality**: Postal code validation system recommended
- **Financial Data Integrity**: Negative quantities indicate source system issues

## 📊 Data Model Design

### Dimensional Model (Star Schema)

#### Fact Table:
- **FACT_Orders**: Central fact table with measures (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit, Delivery Days)

#### Dimension Tables:
- **DIM_Customer**: Customer master data with SCD Type 2
- **DIM_Product**: Product catalog with categories and subcategories  
- **DIM_Geography**: Geographic hierarchy (Country → Region → State → City)
- **DIM_Date**: Time dimension with business calendar support
- **DIM_Ship_Mode**: Shipping methods and service levels

#### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Role-Playing Dimensions**: DIM_Date serves both Order Date and Ship Date roles
2. **Surrogate Keys**: All dimensions use auto-generated surrogate keys
3. **SCD Type 2**: Customer and Product dimensions maintain history
4. **Data Quality Integration**: Built-in quality scoring and flagging

## ⚙️ Pipeline Implementation

### Automated Data Processing Flow

```python
# 1. File Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
def bronze_layer_processing():
    """
    - Extract latest files for each month from SFTP
    - Handle file naming convention: YYYYMM_Orders_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS
    - Preserve complete audit trail
    - Store raw data exactly as received
    """
    
# 2. Data Cleaning (Silver Layer)  
def silver_layer_processing():
    """
    - Apply data quality rules and validations
    - Standardize formats (dates, currencies, text)
    - Calculate derived fields (delivery days)
    - Generate quality scores and flags
    """
    
# 3. Dimensional Modeling (Gold Layer)
def gold_layer_processing():
    """
    - Build dimension tables with proper normalization
    - Create fact table with foreign key relationships
    - Implement slowly changing dimensions (SCD)
    - Optimize for analytical query performance
    """
```

### Data Quality Framework

#### Validation Rules Implemented:
- **Completeness**: Check for missing critical values
- **Validity**: Validate data types and formats
- **Accuracy**: Cross-reference geographic data
- **Consistency**: Ensure referential integrity
- **Uniqueness**: Identify and resolve duplicates

#### Quality Scoring Algorithm:
```python
Quality Score = 100 - (
    Missing_Critical_Fields_Penalty +
    Invalid_Format_Penalty + 
    Duplicate_Records_Penalty +
    Business_Rule_Violations_Penalty
)
```
